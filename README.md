# DataProcessingStorage
Setup:
Run the file using normal python such as python ./main.py to see what the output would be if you run the program using all the functions in the Extra credit assignment

Proposed Modifications:
I believe it would be beneficial if the program was made more specific. As of this moment, the program always breaks after the second call because a transaction is not in progress. I wasn't sure exactly how to change functionality so when I tested I would simply comment out this code. Some more clarification as to how exactly to go about inputs (such as maybe taking in inputs vs just hard coding) would be helpful. I think a method of taking in inputs would be the best way to go about this but I did not code this route as I just put what was already shown in the assignment so I don't lose any points. Adding this feature wouldn't take much time and would allow the students to have multiple test cases to try out. Other than that, I thought this assignment was really interesting.
